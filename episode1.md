INT. CUBICLE LANDSCAPE, DAY

ADAM and CARL are sitting in opposing cubicles working on their
computer.

                      CARL
          Stop looking at my screen, Adam,
          ok.

                      ADAM
          I am not looking at your screen,
          Carl.

                      CARL
          Look, I can see you looking at my
          screen, don't deny it, ok, this is
          very important... ok.

                      ADAM
          I am just trying to work here, I am
          _not_ looking at your screen, It
          just so happens to be in my field
          of view.

                      CARL
          I just don't like it when people
          look at my code, ok, this is very
          sensitive work. Zygomatic
          endomorphisms are really hard to
          reason about, and plug-ins are only
          co-applicative functors and not
          full-fledged co-monads ...

                (Adam interrupts)

                      ADAM
          Carl, Carl, Carl! I don't care
          about your stupid plug-in. I just
          need to get this done by tomorrow.

                      CARL
          WoW WOW wOw wow. When this plug-in
          is done it is going to blow your
          mind, ok. It's going to be
          inception _all_ over again.

                      ADAM
                (angry)
          The plug-in interface isn't even
          done yet, Carl!

                      CARL
          Blow.... your mind... ok.
                (Small silence)
          You wouldn't understand.
