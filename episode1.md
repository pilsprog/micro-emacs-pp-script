* C and A interrupts each other, A is annoyed that he isn't getting any work done *
A - I am just trying to work here, I am _not_ looking at your
    computer screen, It just so happens to be in my field of view...
C - I just don't like it when people look at my code, ok, this
    is very sensitive work I am doing here...
A - I don't care about your dumb plug in Carl, I just need to get this
    done by tomorrow.
C - WoW WOW wOw wow, when this plug-in is done it is going to
    blow your mind, ok. It's going to be inception _all_ over again...
A - THE PLUG-IN INTERFACE ISN'T EVEN DONE YET CARL!
C - Blow.... your mind... ok.
A - NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHAT THIS PILE OF SHIT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON
    ALL THIS TIME IS SUPPOSED TO DO CARL.
C - You wouldn't understand.
* Adam still a bit pissed*
A - No.. No.. Tell me, what is it that you have been wasting everybodys
    time all year doing.
C - Well... Ok, then... Its actually quite web 2.0, you know... Its this thing 
    to share small messages and pictures with each other, and remind them of
    birthdays and stuff like that.
A - So its facebook.
C - No, no, no, its all inside micro-emacs and you can share...
A - So it's facebook for the text editor?
