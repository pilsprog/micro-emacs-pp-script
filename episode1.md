ADAM and CARL are sitting in opposing cubicles working on their
computer.

                      CARL
          Stop look at my computer screen,
          Adam.

                      ADAM
          I am not looking at your computer
          screen.

                      CARL
          Look, I can see you looking at my
          computer screen, don't deny it, ok,
          this is very important..

CARL and ADAM interrupts each other, ADAM is annoyed that he
isn't getting any work done.

                      ADAM
          I am just trying to work here, I am
          _not_ looking at your computer
          screen, It just so happens to be in
          my field of view...

                      CARL
          I just don't like it when people
          look at my code, ok, this is very
          sensitive work I am doing here...

                      ADAM
          I don't care about your dumb plug
          in CARL, I just need to get this
          done by tomorrow.

                      CARL
          WoW WOW wOw wow. When this plug-in
          is done it is going to blow your
          mind, ok. It's going to be
          inception _all_ over again...

                      ADAM
                (angry)
          The plug-in interface isn't even
          done yet carl!

                      CARL
          Blow.... your mind... ok.

                      ADAM 
                (angry, louder)
          Nobody even knows what this pile of
          shit you have been working on all
          this time is supposed to do carl.

                      CARL
          You wouldn't understand.

                      ADAM
                (ADAM is still a bit pissed)
          No.. No.. Tell me, what is it that
          you have been wasting
          everybodystime all year doing.

                      CARL
          Well... Ok, then... Its actually
          quite web 2.0, you know... Its this
          thing to share small messages and
          pictures with each other, and
          remind them of birthdays and stuff
          like that.

                      ADAM
          So its facebook.

                      CARL
          No, no, no, its all inside
          micro-emacs and you can share...
          
                      ADAM
          So it's facebook for the text
          editor?
                
                (Short silence)

                      CARL
          I bet Marc Zuckerberg didn't have
          to take this kind of assholery...
